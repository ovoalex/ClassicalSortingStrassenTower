# ClassicalSortingStrassenTower
Classical Matrix Multiplication, Sorting Algorithms, Strassen Matrix Multiplication, Tower of Hanoi

##### HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT#####

1. Download and unpack the ClassicalSortingStrassenTower.zip file
2. Place the ClassicalSortingStrassenTower in your home directory
   From cmd: 
3. cd src
   javac *
   java [sortingAlgorithms|TowerOfHanoi|ClassicalMatrixMulti|StrassenMatrixMulti]

    OR
     open VSC
     File > open folder > ClassicalSortingStrassenTower

    --To open Classical Matrix Multiplication--

    then go to src and open ClassicalMatrixMulti
    Run > Start debugging (F5)

    --To open Sorting Algorithms--

    then go to src and open sortingAlgorithms
    Run > Start debugging (F5)

    --To open Strassen Matrix Multiplication--

    then go to src and open StrassenMatrixMulti
    Run > Start debugging (F5)
    
    --To open Tower Of Hanoi--

    then go to src and open TowerOfHanoi
    Run > Start debugging (F5)
  
   It will go in order, to open Quick-sort and Merge-sort, it will be under 
   "sortingAlgorithms".
   Tower of Hanoi is under "TowerOfHanoi"
   For classical matrix multiplication it is under "ClassicalMatrixMulti" 
   For Strassen's matrix multiplication it is under "StrassenMatrixMulti"

4. To open from Eclipse
   File > OpenFile > ClassicalSortingStrassenTower > src > [sortingAlgorithms|TowerOfHanoi|ClassicalMatrixMulti|StrassenMatrixMulti]
